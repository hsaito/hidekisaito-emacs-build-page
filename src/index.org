This site provides a precompiled build of Emacs prepared by Hideki Saito.

* What is Emacs?
GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more. At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing. The features of GNU Emacs include:

- Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a variety of file types including plain text, source code, and HTML.
- Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new users.
- Full Unicode support for nearly all human languages and their scripts.
- Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical interface.
- A large number of extensions that add other functionality, including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger interface, calendar, and more. Many of these extensions are distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available separately.

(As described in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]])

* Download
Current version: *24.3* (Most of versions below should say *24.3.1*. The least significant part of the version number shows the fact it was recompiled after creating an initial version. However I often base on refreshed version of sourcecode when this happens, this is not always accurate indication of how many times it is recompiled.)

** Binaries
Use the following link to download the build. You can also see the [[file:files/][list of files]] provided here. Some downloads are available through [[http://www.bittorrent.com/][BitTorrent]].
*** Windows
- [[file:files/emacs-24.3-bin-i386-hs.zip][Emacs Build]] and its [[file:files/emacs-24.3-bin-i386-hs.zip.sig][signature file]] ([[http://emacs.hclippr.org/files/emacs-24.3-bin-i386-hs.zip.torrent][Download using BitTorrent]])
- [[file:files/emacs-24.3-barebin-i386-hs.zip][Emacs Barebin Build]] and its [[file:files/emacs-24.3-barebin-i386-hs.zip.sig][signature file]] (mostly useful for upgrading) ([[http://emacs.hclippr.org/files/emacs-24.3-barebin-i386-hs.zip.torrent][Download using BitTorrent]])
- [[file:files/xpm4.dll][XPM library]] and its [[file:files/xpm4.dll.sig][signature]] (This is provided here as lack of this file will affect correct rendering of toolbar and such.)

*** Mac
- [[file:files/Emacs-24_3-hs.dmg][Emacs build dmg disk image]] and its [[file:files/Emacs-24_3-hs.dmg.sig][signature file]] ([[http://emacs.hclippr.org/files/Emacs-24_3-hs.dmg.torrent][Download using BitTorrent]])
- 10.9 users might find [[file:files/Emacs-24_3-hs-MacOS10_9.dmg][Emacs built on 10.9]] ([[file:files/Emacs-24_3-hs-MacOS10_9.dmg.sig][Signature]]) more stable. ([[file:files/Emacs-24_3-hs-MacOS10_9.dmg.torrent][BitTorrent file]] for this is also available.)
*** Linux
Linux precompiled binary was attempted, however, handling of shared library makes it unpractical unless it is coupled with a package manager which can automatically satisfy dependencies, which I will not be committing at this point. Precompiled binaries on Linux will require every dependant shared libraries to exist in the system (and won't even run without them, whether you are using it or not) therefore, to provide /out of the box/ experience with Linux will require every dependencies to be packed into the binary, which is is not very realistic. 

Since making users going through mess of installing dependencies just to run this build is as bad as having them get tools required to compile and then compile one themselves. (Which is not that complicated on Linux, really.) For users not willing to compile the build themselves can either stick with one bundled with the distribution itself, or find third-party package manager who packages latest Emacs for their distributions.

* Mirroring (Experimental)
If you wish to mirror whole set of Emacs distribution here, you may choose to use [[http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html][BitTorrent Sync]] to sync.

Please use the read only code:

This mirror contains distributed files (not website) only.

I've also thrown in some extra goodies in this distribution. (check in /Extras/ directory)

* About the Build

** What is the license?
See [[file:license.org][License Information]].

** What makes Hideki Saito's Emacs Builds different?
Not much. It's probably quite identical to the official binary released by the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Free Software Foundation]]. It may come little earlier than the official build.

*** How do I spot the difference?

If you are using Hideki Saito's Emacs Builds, you will see it is built on one of the following machine:

- MIO (Windows 7)
- MADOKA (Linux x86_64)
- SAYAKA (Linux x86_64)
- NANOHA (Linux x86)
- hidekimac (Mac)

Unless somehow cross compiled, it should typically say it is built on /MIO/ but is subject to change. (This is where the official binary would say /MARVIN/.)
A binary package will also be signed using OpenPGP key AFF2E40B.

** Will it be the latest version?
As long as my interest and compilation environment lasts. I'm moving toward [[http://www.linux.org/][Linux]] these days, and thus, it is possible my self-interest of having self-compiled version of Emacs for Windows will be gone once the transition is complete.[fn::And now the transition is complete, it is possible that no further Windows build will be provided...]

** Which operating systems does it support?
These are general guideline as I have not tested on every platform other than the one I have compiled on. You are more than welcome to try on any of platforms, but as the GPL says, there is "NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM" and rightly so.
*** Windows
It is built and tested on Windows 7. It should run on most of modern, but older Windows NT based platforms (i.e. Windows XP) without much issue, too. It will be probably difficult to run on Windows 9x operating systems. It should also run on newer Windows such as Windows 8, but I have not tested, and currently do not have any plans to test on the platform. It certainly *won't* work with Windows 8's Metro interface (or whatever they call it now...) as it is not coded to handle it and I (or anyone else as far a I know) will not be paying a fee to get it up there.

*** Mac
Built and tested on 10.8. May run on earlier version.

** Which library does it include?
*** For Windows
This distribution is compiled to support all the libraries made available to be supported on Emacs on Windows. Having said that, you will need to download appropriate library to use those features.

- [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libpng.htm][LibPng]]
- [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/jpeg.htm][Jpeg]]
- [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/giflib.htm][GIfLib]]

- [[http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html][LibXml]]
- [[http://www.gnutls.org/][GnuTLS]]

*** For Mac
The distribution should satisfy every dependencies.

** How do I build Emacs?
I have provided [[file:howto.org][documentation]] of how it can be done.

** Where's that splash screen?
You mean [[https://plus.google.com/103005664980673293345/posts/DzmihL834mt][this]]? It's not included. You have to make your own -- look up "fancy splash" in the Customization.


** Is this page authored in Emacs, too?
Of course. Emacs with Org-mode!
