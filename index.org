* About the Build
** What makes Hideki Saito's Emacs Builds different?
Not much. It's probably quite identical to the official binary released by the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Free Software Foundation]]. It may come little earlier than the official build.

*** How do I spot the difference?

If you are using Hideki Saito's Emacs Builds, you will see it is built on one of the following machine:

- MIO
- MADOKA
- SAYAKA
- NANOHA

Unless somehow cross compiled, it should typically say it is built on /MIO/ but is subject to change. (This is where the official binary would say /MARVIN/.)
A binary package will also be signed using OpenPGP key AFF2E40B.

** Will it be the latest version?
As long as my interest and compilation environment lasts. I'm moving toward [[http://www.linux.org/][Linux]] these days, and thus, it is possible my self-interest of having self-compiled version of Emacs for Windows will be gone once the transition is complete.

** Which library does it include?
This distribution is compiled to support all the libraries made available to be supported on Emacs on Windows. Having said that, you will need to download appropriate library to use those features.

- [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libpng.htm][LibPng]]
- [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/jpeg.htm][Jpeg]]
- [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/giflib.htm][GIfLib]]
- [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm][Tiff]]
- [[http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html][LibXml]]
- [[http://www.gnutls.org/][GnuTLS]]

** Where is a [your favorite platform] binaries?
While I actually compile my own Emacs for Linux and Mac OS X, I don't provide them. Most Linux distributions have someone packaging Emacs for their package managers. For Mac OS X, there's an existing effort for [[http://emacsformacosx.com/][binary distribution]].

** Where's that splash screen?
You mean [[https://plus.google.com/103005664980673293345/posts/DzmihL834mt][this]]? It's not included. You have to make your own -- look up "fancy splash" in the Customization.
